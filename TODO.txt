Okay I have too many features to try and remember to add so here we go with a new TODO.txt

##########################
# Minimum Viable Product #
##########################

- Handle multiple device bug trackers
- Handle user registration
- Better ways to deal with spam/nefarious crap than just captcha

#############
     Bot
#############

- Bot registration with each group (for announcements)
- IPC between bot <==> Django
- Bot must announce changes to ticket (including state changes)
- Bug report announcements should be device specific and therefore
  only announce in device-specific groups.
- Add command to list bugs (maybe with pagination?) from telegram
- Support short hashes like git

##########################
# Future features to add #
##########################

- When a device is dropped from official repo,
  close all existing bugs for that device automatically
  as `Won't-Fix` and leave an automated comment saying
  device support has been dropped.
